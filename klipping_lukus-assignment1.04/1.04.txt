Every character has a speed
The  pc's speed is 100. This is "normal speed"
Other characters (monsters) may have other speeds

Lower speeds are faster.

Place all characters in a priority queue, sorted by "next turn" with a 
secondary sort on a sequence number

when the game starts, everybody has a next turn of 0
After a character moves, next turn is updated to current turn + speed

tie breaks on sequence number

current game time is always the next turn of character that was 
last removed from the heap! That is, next turn  *before*  updating!

        - do not need a variable to keep track of nt

Simulations of this sort are called discrete event simulators. There is no need 
to keep track of game time. It's the implicit of the NT. Time is skipped when nothing
is happening!

print the game at the beginning of pc's turn

if you treat characters as terrain,
    1. if a char moves to that spot, they have to remember what terrain 
        they stepped on and the next
    2. 

character_t *character[y][x];

NO REASON FOR AN ARRAY OF CHARACTERS 

malloc characters
put into turn heap
figure out what x,y

create a character map, if no character on point, it is null
    if character, pointer to character

is there a char at location
    no print terrain
    yes print character symbol

characters have pointer
