                Breshamns line algo found for can see function
2/25/2025 8:30: can_see believed to be finished
2/25/2025 8:40: All erattic movements done
2/25/2025 9:17: Finally found massive bug with type def
                was declaring structs with wrong names
2/26/2025 12:20: Fixed bugs
                fixed bugs, program can run without new methods
2/26/2025 1:30: All monster methods believed to be done
