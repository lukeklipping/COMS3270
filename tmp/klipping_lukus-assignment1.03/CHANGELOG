2/13/2025 2:00: changed dungeon[][] into dungeon_t
                added d->map to all functions
2/13/2025 2:20: added new files 
                heap.h and heap.c for path finding out of prof code
2/13/2025 3:00: add djikstra_tunnel()
                for tunneling monsters pathfinding
2/13/2025 3:16: Added djikstrs_non_tunnel()
                for non tunneling pathfinding
2/14/2025 1:00: Working on djikstra algo
                decided that non tunnel is easier to work with first
2/14/2025 1:05: Basing algo off of professors corridor djikstra
2/14/2025 1:30: Created delete_dungeon()
                helper method to make cleaner in main(), frees room array
2/14/2025 1:45: made tunnel and non tunnel arrays
                for path arrays
2/14/2025 2:00: Put hardness array into dungeon_t
                makes it easier and more secure than global variable like before
2/14/2025 3:00: Djikstra progress
                Algorithm must check all 8 neighbors of surrounding cell.
2/14/2025 4:00: continuing debugging of algorithm
2/14/2025 4:45: Made comparators for tunnel and non tunnel
                For heap init. Based off of corridor comparator and what we learned
                in class during insertion sort.
2/14/2025 5:50: algo believed to be working, creating print map function 
2/14/2025 6:00: map function for non tunnel made
2/16/2025 4:00: working on tunnel
                only difference is the hardness calculation, seems simple
2/16/2025 4:45: more tunnel work
                tunnel algo includes all cells that are not immutable
2/16/2025 5:17: tunnel belived to be finished
2/16/2025 6:00: made tunnel path map
                I think its working correctly
2/18/2025 3:00: Believed to be done
                The online class demo helped a lot to determine if correct or not
                Commenting in new methods and documenting what each part does.
                Will turn in soon. Extension on assignment also.
2/19/2025 1:00: working on ReadMe
2/19/2025 1:15: README done
                getting ready to turn in
